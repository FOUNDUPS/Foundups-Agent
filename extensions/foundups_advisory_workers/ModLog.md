# FoundUps Fusion Worker ModLog

## 2026-06-22 - REDDOG_AUTO_ROUTER_SKILLZ_CONTEXT_PHASE1 (v0.3.14)

- Changed RedDog defaults to GLM-5.2 principal, DeepSeek V4 Pro adversarial critic, and Kimi K2.7 Code implementation critic.
- Removed Mode/Effort/Context from the 012-facing prompt controls; routing and context now resolve automatically from WSP_15 task classification.
- Added bounded Skillz/Wardrobe/Rolodex/OpenClaw/Hermes discovery to HIGH/ULTRA context packets for governed handoff recommendations.
- Added visible `RedDog Routing` output and review-packet metadata for resolved effort, mode, context, principal, and panel.
- Wired Skillz/Wardrobe/Rolodex context into `buildBoundedRepoContext` for HIGH/ULTRA modes; ULTRA git diff now includes `wsp_holo_git_skillz`.
- Extended architect output schema: Architect Trace (structured CoR, not raw CoT), Verification gaps, mode-selection reasoning, Fusion panel structure validation.
- Added WSP_97 truth table to README/INTERFACE; recorded future slices in ROADMAP.
- Preserved advisory-only boundary: the extension can recommend handoffs but cannot execute Skillz, shell, OpenClaw, Hermes, repo, browser, merge, or deployment actions.
## 2026-06-22 - REDDOG_FUSION_ORCHESTRATOR_TRACKING_PHASE1 (git land)

- First tracked commit of `extensions/foundups_advisory_workers/` and `scripts/advisory_model_once.py`.
- VSIX remains a local build artifact only (`*.vsix` gitignored; package via `vsce package --no-dependencies`).
- No behavior change from v0.3.13 gate; discoverability/PR scope only.
- Explicit non-overlap: livechat #841 selective cancellation untouched.

WSP: WSP_22, WSP_49, WSP_97.

## 2026-06-22 - REDDOG_FUSION_ORCHESTRATOR_PHASE1 (v0.3.13)

- Added internal orchestrator contract in `extension.js`:
  - `classifyTaskForRedDog` WSP_15-style task classifier
  - `resolveAutoEffort` auto effort selection (ULTRA/HIGH/REGULAR)
  - `resolveModelMode` RedDog WSP default to auditable manual panel
  - `validateRedDogOutput` required schema section validator
  - `buildRepairPrompt` bounded one-pass repair helper
- Substantive RedDog answers now require WSP_97 Truth Labels in the output schema.
- On missing schema sections, run one repair pass through the existing redaction-gated bridge; attach validator/repair status to review packet.
- OpenRouter Fusion alias remains selectable but is not the RedDog WSP default.
- Extended contract tests in `tests/verify_extension_contract.js` (15 assertions including inject/revert classifier paths).

WSP: WSP_00, WSP_15, WSP_22, WSP_97, WSP_109.

## 2026-06-22 - RedDog Architect Webview Contract (v0.3.12)

- Reworked the Cursor webview into a VS Code terminal/chat-style surface:
  - compact header
  - scrollback output pane
  - fixed bottom composer
  - no separate status notices outside output
  - `Enter` sends and `Shift+Enter` inserts newline
- Added worker controls:
  - RedDog Architect
  - WSP Gate Critic
  - Repair Planner
  - Smoke Test
- Added effort controls:
  - Auto
  - Regular
  - High
  - Ultra
- Strengthened WSP operating prompt:
  - WSP_00 role/origin framing
  - WSP_97 truth labels
  - WSP_15 priority block at bottom
  - proposed fix required for every finding
  - HoloIndex retrieval weakness must become a remediation finding
- Changed HoloIndex context gathering to WSP_00 bundle-json first with `HOLO_SKIP_MODEL=1`, falling back to offline lexical only if bundle recall fails.
- Updated the bridge so prompt and bounded context are redaction-gated separately and the explicit RedDog system prompt reaches regular, Fusion alias, and manual panel modes.
- Added Tier-0/Tier-1 memory files for HoloIndex discoverability: `INTERFACE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ModLog.md`, and `tests/TestModLog.md`.

WSP: WSP_00, WSP_15, WSP_22, WSP_87, WSP_97, WSP_109.
