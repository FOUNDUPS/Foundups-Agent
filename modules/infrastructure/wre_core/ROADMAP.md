# WRE Core Roadmap

## FoundUp job router and consumer WSP62 decomposition

The create-route prerequisite now isolates its routing decision in
`src/foundup_job_route_decision.py`; every function in that module and the
public `route_foundup_job` entrypoint is at or below 75 lines.

Remaining inherited WSP 62 debt is recorded with exact, non-ratcheting
ceilings in `wsp_62_exemptions.yaml`:

- Split envelope, evidence-reference, live-mode, and compute-budget validation
  out of `src/foundup_job_router.py`.
- Split Hermes dispatch, dry-run context attachment, and queue-retention
  orchestration out of `src/foundup_job_consumer.py`.
- Remove each function exemption when its extracted replacement is at or below
  75 lines, then remove the file exemption when the host is at or below the
  canonical file threshold.

Target: complete the decomposition before the temporary exemptions expire on
2026-09-30, without widening any recorded ceiling.
