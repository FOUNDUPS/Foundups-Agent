# GotJUNK? Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to update the existing Google Cloud Run deployment from the new module location in `modules/foundups/gotjunk/`.

## Method 1: AI Studio Redeploy (Recommended)

This is the **easiest and safest** method for updating your deployed app.

### Steps:

1. **Make Changes Locally**
   ```bash
   cd modules/foundups/gotjunk/frontend

   # Edit files as needed
   # Example: Update App.tsx, add features, etc.
   ```

2. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies (first time only)
   npm install

   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # Edit .env.local and add your GEMINI_API_KEY
   # GEMINI_API_KEY_GotJunk=your_actual_api_key_here

   # Run development server
   npm run dev

   # Visit http://localhost:5173 to test
   ```

3. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build

   # This creates the dist/ folder with optimized files
   ```

4. **Upload to AI Studio**
   - Open: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1R_lBYHwMJHOxWjI_HAAx5DU9fqePG9nA
   - Click the file upload icon
   - Upload changed files from `frontend/` directory
   - Or edit directly in AI Studio's code editor

5. **Redeploy**
   - Click the 🚀 rocket icon (top right)
   - Select your Google Cloud project
   - Click **"Redeploy app"**
   - Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

6. **Verify**
   - Visit your Cloud Run URL
   - Test the updated functionality
   - Check browser console for errors

### Important Notes:
- ✅ **Preserves existing deployment** - same URL, same project
- ✅ **Zero downtime** - Cloud Run handles rolling updates
- ⚠️ **Overwrites Cloud Run source editor changes** - always deploy from AI Studio
- 💡 **Environment variables** - Set in Cloud Run console if needed

---

## Method 2: Cloud Run Source Editor

For quick fixes, you can edit directly in Cloud Run (but changes will be overwritten by AI Studio redeploy).

### Steps:

1. **Open Cloud Run Console**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/run
   - Select your project
   - Find the GotJUNK? service

2. **Edit Source**
   - Click "Edit source" button
   - Make changes in the web editor
   - Click "Save and redeploy"

3. **Verify**
   - Wait for deployment
   - Test at your Cloud Run URL

### Warning:
⚠️ **These changes will be LOST** when you redeploy from AI Studio!
- Only use for emergency hotfixes
- Immediately sync changes back to `modules/foundups/gotjunk/frontend/`

---

## Method 3: Automated Deployment (Future)

We can create a deployment script for automated updates.

### Planned Features:
- `./deployment/deploy.sh` - One-command deployment
- GitHub Actions integration
- Automatic environment variable injection
- Rollback support

**Status**: Not yet implemented (see ROADMAP.md Prototype phase)

---

## Environment Variables

### Required:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY_GotJunk=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Setting in Cloud Run:

1. **Via Console**:
   - Go to Cloud Run service
   - Click "Edit & Deploy New Revision"
   - Scroll to "Container" section
   - Add environment variable: `GEMINI_API_KEY_GotJunk`
   - Click "Deploy"

2. **Via AI Studio** (Recommended):
   - Set in `.env.local` locally
   - AI Studio handles environment variables during redeploy

---

## Common Issues

### Issue: "GEMINI_API_KEY_GotJunk is not defined"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Create .env.local
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit and add your key
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY_GotJunk=your_actual_key_here" > .env.local

# Rebuild
npm run build
```

### Issue: "Camera not working"

**Cause**: Not using HTTPS
**Solution**: Always test camera features on Cloud Run (HTTPS) or localhost

### Issue: "Geolocation permission denied"

**Solution**:
- Browser needs HTTPS for geolocation
- Click "Allow" when prompted
- Check browser settings if blocked

### Issue: "Build fails in AI Studio"

**Solution**:
1. Run `npm run build` locally to catch errors
2. Check TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
3. Ensure all dependencies in `package.json`
4. Check AI Studio console logs

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Test locally with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Run build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Check for TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Verify `.env.example` is up to date
- [ ] Update INTERFACE.md if API changed
- [ ] Update ModLog.md with changes
- [ ] Test camera permissions
- [ ] Test geolocation
- [ ] Test offline mode (PWA)
- [ ] Verify export functionality
- [ ] Check bundle size: `npm run build` (should be <1MB)
- [ ] Review Cloud Run logs after deployment

---

## Monitoring

### Cloud Run Logs:
```bash
# View logs in real-time
gcloud logging tail --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --resource-type=cloud_run_revision

# Or use Cloud Console:
# https://console.cloud.google.com/run > Your Service > Logs
```

### Performance Metrics:
- **Startup Time**: Should be <2s
- **Request Latency**: Should be <500ms
- **Memory Usage**: Should be <256MB
- **Cold Start**: Should be <3s

---

## Rollback

If deployment fails or has issues:

1. **Via AI Studio**:
   - Keep backup of previous version (Download ZIP)
   - Upload old files
   - Redeploy

2. **Via Cloud Run Console**:
   - Go to "Revisions" tab
   - Click previous revision
   - Click "Manage Traffic"
   - Set 100% traffic to old revision

---

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Monitor**: Check Cloud Run logs for errors
2. **Test**: Verify all features work in production
3. **Document**: Update ModLog.md with deployment details
4. **Share**: Add production URL to README.md and INTERFACE.md
5. **Plan**: Review ROADMAP.md for next features

**Deployment Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy from modules/foundups/gotjunk/

## Authorization rules release gate (2026-10-10)

The GitHub `deploy-gotjunk.yml` workflow now gates a production release on the
credential-free Firestore and Storage emulator regression suite. PRs run this
suite but cannot enter the credential-bearing deployment job. Deployment is
restricted to `main` and serialized to avoid simultaneous rule/frontend releases.

The existing GCP auth action writes the service account's Application Default
Credentials file. Firebase CLI **14.27.0**, the version used for local emulator
validation, uses that file to deploy only Firestore rules and Storage rules:

```sh
cd modules/foundups/gotjunk
firebase deploy --config firebase.json --project gen-lang-client-0061781628 \
  --only firestore:rules,storage --non-interactive
```

Both `.firebaserc` and the frontend's Firebase project ID bind to
`gen-lang-client-0061781628`; the workflow asserts that match before deployment.
Cloud Build uploads a clean archive of the tracked commit, excluding the auth
action's runner credential file and all other untracked workspace files.

No indexes, database data, hosting configuration, credentials, or IAM permissions
are changed by this command. Authorization failures stop the workflow before the
frontend Cloud Build. Do not bypass that failure: the existing service account
must receive the appropriate Firebase rule-deployment access through its owner.

Rules become stricter before the new frontend is rolled out. Existing clients
can temporarily fail old-style writes until refreshed. If the subsequent build
fails, leave the restrictive rules in place and fix/retry the matching frontend;
do not automatically restore vulnerable rules. The Python Liberty Alert API is
a separate deployment and is not launched by this static frontend workflow.

Workflow source and emulator success are not deployment receipts. Confirm the
actual CI run, Firebase rules release and Cloud Run revision separately.
